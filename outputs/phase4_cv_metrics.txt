Phase 4 — Cross-Validation (R2)
CV strategy: KFold(n_splits=2, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
Features: Length_m
Target: Load_kN

LinearRegression:
- Mean R2: -264.431
- Std  R2: 242.899

DecisionTree:
- Mean R2: -9.898
- Std  R2: 0.898

Notes:
- Dataset is extremely small; R2 is unstable and can be strongly negative.
- n_splits was chosen to keep at least 2 samples in each test fold.
