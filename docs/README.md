# Digital Civil AI

This project demonstrates a Python-based data analysis pipeline
for civil engineering applications.

## Phase 1 – Data Analysis
- Read structural element data from CSV
- Perform data quality checks
- Clean invalid and missing data
- Compute engineering metrics (load per meter)
- Apply engineering validation rules

## How to run
```bash
python phase1-intero.py
